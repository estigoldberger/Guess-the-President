# Match-the-President

This repo is for the implemenation of the Match-the-President Game.

In this game, players can pick from any set of buttons to reveal a president. After selecting one from the left, they do the same from the set of buttons on the left. When they are done, it is the second player's turn. 
The second player does the same. The first player to pick two matching cards is the winner!
